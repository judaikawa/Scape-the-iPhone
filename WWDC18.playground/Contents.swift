 Hi there! Something really odd has happened. Poor Aria got somehow stuck inside someone else's iPhone, and she is trying to get out.
 
 Help her out, by going through the apps. To do so, use the direction buttons to walk around and press the A button while on top of the app you want to take a look.
 
 While inside an app, you can check it's features (you can go ahead and tap the screen to explore the phone) and once done, press the B button to return to the main screen and explore other apps, to try to figure out who this phone belongs to and how to get out.
