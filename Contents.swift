//: # Scape the iPhone
//: A swift playground by Juliana Daikawa

 Hi there! Something really odd has happened. Poor Aria got somehow stuck inside someone else's iPhone, and she is trying to get out.
 
 Help her out, by going through the apps. To do so, use the direction buttons  ![descricao](arrow-buttons.png "") (you can also long press if you are in a hurry!) to walk around and press the A button ![descricao](a-button.png "") while on top of the app you want to take a look.
 
 While inside an app, you can check it's features (you can go ahead and tap the screen to explore the app, like a normal iPhone) and once done, press the B button ![descricao](b-button.png "") to return to the main screen and explore other apps, to try to figure out who this phone belongs to and how to get out.
 
 **Hint:** Check every app at least once
 
 
 You can also press the start button ![descricao](start-button.png "") for help and credits, while on the main screen.
